# core files fixer
This repo contains a .cmd file that I made that is used to repair corrupted system files for Windows.
# How to use
Easy, just download the script.cmd file, then run it as the administrator. **Administrator privilege is required to fix core system files.** This script will take some time, so
patiently wait until SFC and DISM command finishes repairing. After the command is done, press any key to quit, and a **Restart is required to make changes.**
